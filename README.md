# queue-router
Flask-based REST API for routing queued data between distributed clients.

A client hits the `/register` endpoint, and is assigned a UUID address. This address can then used to enque and dequeu data from that client's queue using the `/enqueue` and `/dequeue` endpoints. Requests to `/enque` with no address specified add the data to all active clients' queues.

This is designed to allow browser-based clients to behave somewhat like a decentralised network. This is a rather _niche_ use case. Further, while the API is designed to be simple and lightweight, it is unlikely to scale well for production use. Something like RabbitMQ or Redis may be better.
